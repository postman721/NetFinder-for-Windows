<b>About project’s structure:</b>

dist folder has .jar files. These are the executables you want to run.

src folder has project sources.

nbproject folder has Netbeans project files.

<b>Dependencies/Building:</b>

The program needs Java JRE 1.8 or equivalent to run.

Windows users should go to Oracle´s website and get Java JRE from there.

To build the project yourself install Netbeans. With Netbeans you can then import and build the project.

This program was tested with Windows 10 but it should run with older versions as well. You should be able to run the .jar file easily without compiling the project. With Windows all you need to do is double-click the .jar file and the program should start.

On Windows 10 the default browser is Edge. To change this go to Control panel -> Programs -> Default programs. Then choose Set default programs and make your choice. My Windows 10 is in Finnish, so the previous is a rough translation – the entries might be named differently in an actual English system. In any case, search engines will help you out – if confusion strikes.
